# Both-Edge-Counter
The counter will start counting with each clock edges if enable pin is active high.

# Key Features:
Dual-Edge Counting: The counter responds to both rising and falling edges of the clock.
Enable Control:     Counting starts only when the enable pin is high.
Clock Efficiency:   The design allows for faster counting by utilizing both clock edges.
